exam system
The purpose of on-line test simulator is to take online test in an efficientmanner and no time wasting for checking the paper. 
The main objective of online test simulator is to efficiently evaluate the candidate thoroughlythrough a fully automated system that not only saves lot of time but alsogives fast results
Hard ware Requirements

1. Pentium with 233MHz or better
2. 64MB RAM minimum (128MB RAM) recommended
3. 800*600 resolution; 16 bit color (1024*768)
4. For offline message audio is preferred, but no need.
    15” monitor (17” monitor recommended for best results)

2.2	Software Requirements
Presentation Layer	HTML XML 

Network Layer
	TCP/IP
Web Server Layer	Tomcat, Servlets,  JDBC,JSP
Language Specification	J2SE
Databases	Oracle8i

Communication Protocols
Network Protocol
 	 TCP/IP Protocol (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the Network Protocol used on the Internet. TCP/IP allows reasonably efficient and error Free transmission between different systems. Because it is a File Transfer Protocol, it can send large amount of information across networks with Great assurance that the data will arrive uncorrupted.   
Technical Feasibility
           Technical feasibility centers around the existing computer system ((hardware and software) whether it can support the addition of proposed system, if not, to what extent it can support and the organization’s capacity to acquire additional components.

Our proposed system is technically feasible because –
•	The hardware and software required are easy to install and handle
•	The necessary hardware configuration and software platform is already there 
•	The system supports interactivity with the user through GUI
Technical feasibility centers around the existing computer system (hardware and software) whether it can support the addition of proposed system, if not to what extend it can support the organization’s capacity to acquire required additional components. 
 Proposed system is technically feasible because of the following reasons:-
I.	It’s required less system resources.
II.	Expandability will be maintained in the new system. New modules can be added later on the application, if required in the future.
III.	The application will have User-friendly Forms and Screens, all validation checks. So the new system guarantees accuracy, reliability, ease of access and data security. 


Modules
	The main modules involved in the Online Evaluator are as follows:
                 User 
                     Registered User
                     Unregistered User  
                     Login

Class Diagram
Class diagrams are the backbone of the almost every object oriented method including UML. 
  They describe the static  structure of a system. Classes represent an abstraction of entities with common characteristics. Associations represent the relationships between classes.
 Illustrate classes with rectangles divided into compartments. Place the name of the class in the first partition (centered, bolded and capitalizes), list the attributes in the second partition and write operations into third.
Active classes initiate and control the flow of activity, while passive classes store data and serve other classes. Illustrate active 
classes with a thick border

 Sequence Diagram
•	Sequence diagrams commonly contain the following:
	Objects
	Links
	Messages
Like all other diagrams, sequence diagrams may contain notes and constrains
